# Professional Portfolio

## Description:

* This website is designed to help employers to better discover my core strengths based on my previous projects, and able to reach out to me through my contact information. 
* This project was completed based on the basic HTML & CSS concepts, producing an intuitive, responsive demonstration of my professional profile.
* During the process of building the website, I have learned the tools & skills necessary to design a website that is clear, responsive to various screen sizes and how to troubleshoot the mysterious mistakes and object misplacements using Chrome's DevTools.

## Built By:
